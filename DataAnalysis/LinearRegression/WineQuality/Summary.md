<b>MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS</b>

Using appropriate software, you have to build a multiple linear regression model that can explain/forecast a dependent variable of your choice.<br>

Analysis must consider a starting database of at least 9 variables (including the dependent one, y) and at least 15 complete observations. <br>Of course, the final model will include only the proper variables.<br>
You are supposed to work on sample data from your business or obtained from any source (internet of course included)<br><br>

Prepare a final report (Executive Summary) in which you describe the model obtained, its interpretation and the steps of the analysis you ran (format .doc, .ppt, or .pdf).
<br>
In the Executive Summary you need to highlight:<br>
•	The problem you want to address<br>
•	The Database description<br>
•	Your Preliminary analysis with your decisions about data<br>
•	Key steps of the analysis<br>
•	The final model and its description<br>
•	The business implications of your model<br>
