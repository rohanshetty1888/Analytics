<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>

To identify the pricing dynamics for a leading household cleaning supplies brand in US market.<br>
•	Create a robust imputation logic where price data is missing.<br>
•	Is the price elasticity increasing or decreasing over time?<br>
•	What is the impact of key competitor’s pricing on the target brand?<br>
 
<b>Available Data:</b><br>
•	I had data for a particular retailer (say Retailer 1).<br>
•	Retailer had data for different Product Styles.Product Styles are basically different SKUs of a Brand / Product.<br>
•	My Target Product Style was "Brand T" with SKUs T1, T2, T3 and T4.<br>
•	Price Column was missing and needed to be derived using Amount Sold and Units Sold column.<br>
